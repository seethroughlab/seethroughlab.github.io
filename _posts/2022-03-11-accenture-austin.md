While working with Landor & Fitch, I took on my first professional TouchDesigner project after months of self-directed training and experimentation. The client wanted an interactive storefront window for their office on South Congress Street in Austin. It needed to:

- Tie into their existing branding
- Announce to Austin that Accenture was part of the community by providing a fun interactive experience, especailly ahead of 2022 SXSW
- Allow for updates and design changes by the on-site Accenture staff

I worked closely with <a href="https://www.an-luc.com/">An Luc</a> to develop 4 different modes; two of which were based on existing motion graphics studies and two were particle systems (which was a great excuse to use compute shaders to push the hardware to its limits). 

I was happy with the results and grateful that L&F gave me the opportunity to put my new TouchDesigner knowledge to the test.

Due to a scheduling conflict, I was not able to go to Austin to actually install the piece, and <a href="http://stansanders.com/">Stan Sanders</a> took my place.  He wisely chose to swap in the Zed 2 camera for the Kinect Azsure I had used during development, which ended up working very well.
