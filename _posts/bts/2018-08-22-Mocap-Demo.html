                        <h1>Mocap Demo</h1>
                        <p>A general cleanup of the mocap to get rid of glitches is needed. Specifically, here are the things that need to be fixed.

0:04-0:07 - Right hand doesn&#x27;t hang naturally - falls a little in front of the leg 
0:10-0:14 - Right arm is twisted at an odd angle. The hand is twisted in an unnatural way, and the whole arm seems tilted across the body in an unnatural way.
0:18-0:21 - The right leg glitches a bit as she steps forward.
0:22-0:28 - Right hand is twisted oddly at the wrist. Actually, it seems to me that it&#x27;s twisted at the elbow, but I&#x27;m not sure.
0:30-0:45 - the head seemed to not move at all when she hugs you so the user has to move their head unnaturally to the side without ending up looking inside her head. I was asking if we can make her head move more naturally to the side like it would in a hug.
0:49-end: The right hand hangs behind the leg and overlaps the leg.</p>
