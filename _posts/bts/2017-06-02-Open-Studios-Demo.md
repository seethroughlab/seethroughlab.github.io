  In this demo I am attempting to build a world using only consumer-grade capture equipment, including the Occipital Structure 3D camera for environment scanning and Kinect for motion capture. As you can see, it's extremely glitchy, so I decided to embrace it and try to develop effects and shaders that compliment the existing aesthetic. The result is a kind of self-portrait/portrait of my studio that I hope to translate into a full game some day. 
  
  I am showing a Vive demo of this at the Greenpoint Open Studios Launch Party tonight, June 2, 2017.
