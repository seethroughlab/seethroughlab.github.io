I helped Pierre Huyghe, Martial Geoffre-Rouland, and the Kunsten Museum mount an exhibition of some of Pierre's work. My role was to create and install some custom software that connected all of the existing works that were being put on display, and choreographed their behavior. This involved interfacing with switchable glass and a Modulo Pi media server, reiprogramming masks made of LED matricies for Wifi communication,
