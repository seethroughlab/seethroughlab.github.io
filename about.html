                <h2>See-through Lab is Jeff Crouse, who goes by a few titles: Interactive Director, Creative Technologist, Technical Director.</h2>

                <p>Since 2007, I have been collaborating with artists, studios, and agencies to create immersive experiences that utilize emerging technologies thoughtfully to create ground-breaking, award winning experiences. My work is informed by my studies in storytelling and game design and my experience in advertising, architecture, and entertainment. I create projects that transport and inspire, grounded in the fundamentals of interactivity and narrative, but with an eye towards new paradigms. Using interactivity to tell stories is rarely straightforward, but the process of problem solving is what keeps me excited about each new project.</p>

                <p>My specialty is acting as a bridge between the creative and the technical. As a former full-time digital artist, I have experience concepting and pitching. I prefer to be involved in a project from the beginning to help clients to craft concepts that are feasible but ambitious. That challenge users while also being accessible. That effectively communicate a message in a way that is only possible with immersive and interactive media.</p>

                <p>In production I am almost always hands-on. I strongly believe in using the right tool for the job and putting the concept first, which requires flexibility and willingness to learn on the job. I also bring my eight years of experience as a creative coding teacher to the job when working with teams. </p>

                <p>I believe in thorough prototyping and an iterative workflow. I work closely with designers, directors, animators, musicians, engineers, fabricators, and photographers to build, test, and refine interactive experiences. Over 13 years and dozens of projects, I have built up a process for just such an iterative workflow while also staying flexible enough to slot into most teams.</p>

                <p>Letâ€™s chat about how I can help you with your interactive/immersive project.</p>
