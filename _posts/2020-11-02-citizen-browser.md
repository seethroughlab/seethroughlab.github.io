From October 2020 to August of 2022, I helped <a href="https://themarkup.org/">The Markup</a> launch and maintain a groundbreaking application that was used by thousands of <a href="https://today.yougov.com/">YouGov</a> panelists. The application used a screen scraping tool created by <a href="https://netograph.io/">Netograph</a> to capture (heavily redacted) snapshots of panelist's Facebook feeds, groups, and pages. These snapshots would then be uploaded to a back end that organized the data for journalists at The Markup to analyze and eventually turn into stories.

Note: I was not the first programmer on this project and did not begin the application. But I inherited it at about 60% completion. I finished the sofware, supported it through launch and over a year of real-world usage, and finally the shutdown of the project.
