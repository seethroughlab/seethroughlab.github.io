 MKG came to me with the idea of building an interactive canyon. After working closely with their design team, we landed on a concept that I called "Galaxy Busting", in which people interacted with a puddle of light on the ground. When drops from this puddle were disturbed enough to fly out to the walls, the visitor would be rewarded with waves of colored light.
