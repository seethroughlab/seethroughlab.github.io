  What you see:
  1. I'm sending some junk data to the screen "1711 careful need", etc
  2. In the background, an old IBM commercial had just started playing
  3. I pan over to another surveillance screen where a (badly aligned) GIF from the tumblr is playing
  4. Pan back to the first surveillance screen, the IBM commercial has ended and it the background becomes a (slightly "modified") camera view from a camera beside the table. I thought this would be a sneaky way for the audience to get a "behind the scenes" look occasionally.
